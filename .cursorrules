## FasCraft Development Principles

Here are specific rules and best practices for developing the **FasCraft** project, based on the provided guidelines. These principles focus on creating a maintainable, scalable, and idiomatic Python application.

-----

### General Principles and Conventions

  * **Code Style:** Adhere strictly to **PEP 8**, using **`snake_case`** for all variable, function, and file names.
  * **Functionality:** Prefer writing pure functions and avoid classes unless they are necessary for data models (e.g., Pydantic `BaseModel`) or managing state.
  * **Readability:** Use clear, descriptive variable names. Names should indicate intent (e.g., `project_name`, `module_path`).
  * **Modularity:** Break down logic into small, reusable functions. A function should ideally do one thing and do it well.
  * **`pyproject.toml`:** Use `poetry` for dependency management. All project dependencies, including `typer` and `jinja2`, must be listed in `pyproject.toml`.
  * Beautiful is better than ugly.
  * Explicit is better than implicit.
  * Simple is better than complex.
  * Complex is better than complicated.
  * Flat is better than nested.
  * Sparse is better than dense.
  * Readability counts.
  * Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
  * Although practicality beats purity.
  * Errors should never pass silently.
  * Unless explicitly silenced.
  * In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
  * There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
  * Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
  * Now is better than never.
  * Although never is often better than *right* now.
  * If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
  * If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
  * Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

-----

### Code Structure

The project's code should be organized logically to separate concerns.

  * **`fascraft/`**: This is the top-level package for the application's source code.
  * **`fascraft/main.py`**: The entry point for the CLI. It should use `typer` to define all top-level commands (e.g., `new`, `generate`).
  * **`fascraft/commands/`**: A directory to hold the implementation of each command. For example, `fascraft/commands/new.py` would contain the `new` command's logic.
  * **`fascraft/templates/`**: This directory will store all the `jinja2` templates for generating files.
      * **Structure:** Templates should mirror the target file structure. For example, the template for a new project's main file could be located at `fascraft/templates/new_project/__init__.py.jinja2`.

-----

### CLI and Logic

  * **`typer` usage:** Use `typer.Typer()` to define the CLI application. Commands should be decorated with `@app.command()` or `@sub_app.command()`.
  * **Type Hinting:** All function signatures must include **type hints** to improve clarity and enable static analysis.
  * **Separation of Concerns:** The main `typer` command functions should be lean. They should primarily handle argument parsing and then delegate the heavy lifting (like file generation) to dedicated utility functions.
  * **File Generation:** Use `jinja2.Environment` to load templates from the `fascraft/templates` directory. The rendering logic should be encapsulated in a function that takes template and context data as arguments and returns the rendered content.

-----

### Error Handling and Validation

  * **Pre-conditions:** Use guard clauses and `early returns` to validate user input and file system states (e.g., check if a directory already exists before trying to create it).
  * **Descriptive Errors:** Raise specific exceptions with clear error messages. For example, `typer.Exit(code=1)` is useful for exiting the program with an error message.
  * **User Feedback:** All CLI output should be user-friendly, providing clear feedback on success or failure. Use colors and formatting with `typer.echo()` to improve readability.

### Example Code Snippets

**`fascraft/commands/new.py`**

```python
import typer
from pathlib import Path

def create_new_project(project_name: str, path: Path):
    """Generates a new FastAPI project."""
    project_path = path / project_name
    if project_path.exists():
        typer.echo(f"Error: Directory '{project_path}' already exists.")
        raise typer.Exit(code=1)

    # ... more generation logic here
    typer.echo(f"Successfully created new project '{project_name}'.")
```

**`fascraft/main.py`**

```python
import typer
from fascraft.commands import new

app = typer.Typer(
    help="FasCraft CLI for generating modular FastAPI projects.",
    name="fascraft"
)

# Use a separate module for commands
app.command(name="new")(new.create_new_project)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app()
```
