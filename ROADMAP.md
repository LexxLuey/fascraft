FastForge is an exciting project! It has the potential to become an indispensable tool for Python developers who want to quickly build scalable and well-structured FastAPI applications. Here is a comprehensive roadmap and project overview to guide our development.

***

### Project Overview: FastForge

FastForge is a **CLI tool designed to streamline the creation and management of modular FastAPI projects**. Its primary goal is to eliminate boilerplate code and enforce best practices from the start, allowing developers to focus on business logic. By providing a clean, organized, and opinionated project structure, FastForge will help developers build high-quality, scalable APIs faster.

The key problem FastForge solves is the initial setup time and the inconsistent quality of new projects. Instead of starting from scratch or copying and pasting old code, a developer can use a single command to generate a project that is ready to go, complete with:

* A logical directory structure (e.g., `routers`, `services`, `database`).
* Dependency injection.
* Pydantic models for data validation.
* Configured database connections.

This approach ensures that every project starts with a **solid architectural foundation**.

### Project Roadmap

The development of FastForge can be broken down into a clear, phased roadmap. Each phase builds upon the last, delivering a more robust and useful tool with every milestone.

#### **Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** üöÄ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

The goal of this phase is to prove the core concept and create a functional command-line tool.

* **Core Functionality:** Create the `fastforge` CLI using `typer`. ‚úÖ
* **Initial Command:** Implement a single `fastforge new <project_name>` command. ‚úÖ
* **Template Engine:** Use `jinja2` to render a single, simple boilerplate template for a FastAPI project. ‚úÖ
* **Project Structure:** The template will generate a basic project with a single `main.py` and a `pyproject.toml` file. ‚úÖ
* **Output:** The CLI will create the project directory, render the template files, and provide a success message. ‚úÖ

**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - FastForge MVP is fully functional with 100% test coverage (36/36 tests passing). The CLI successfully generates complete FastAPI projects with all necessary files including `__init__.py`, `main.py`, `pyproject.toml`, and `README.md`.

#### **Phase 2: Modular Generation** üèóÔ∏è

This is where the "forge" aspect of the tool truly comes to life. We will introduce more complex templates and new commands.

* **Enhanced Templates:** Expand the template directory to include a full, opinionated project structure, with subdirectories for `routers`, `services`, `database`, and `models`.
* **New Command:** Implement `fastforge generate <module_name>` to add a new module (e.g., a `users` or `items` module) to an existing FastForge project. This command will generate:
    * A new router file in the `routers` directory.
    * A new Pydantic model in the `models` directory.
* **Project Context:** The `generate` command will be smart enough to understand the existing project structure and where to place the new files.
* **Initial Documentation:** Begin writing a basic `README.md` and a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file to guide early users and contributors.

By the end of this phase, FastForge will be able to not only create new projects but also help developers scale them with new modules. 

#### **Phase 3: Customization and Enhancements** ‚öôÔ∏è

This phase focuses on making FastForge more flexible and powerful.

* **Template Options:** Allow users to pass flags to the `new` or `generate` commands to customize the output. For example: `fastforge new my_api --db=postgresql`.
* **Database Integration:** Create different templates for popular async database libraries like `asyncpg` and `aiomysql`.
* **Configuration Management:** Add a command to update the project's dependencies or configuration files.
* **Tooling Integration:** Include optional templates for linters (`ruff`), formatters (`black`), and testing frameworks (`pytest`).
* **Custom Templates:** Introduce the ability for users to specify their own local template directories, making the tool highly extensible.

#### **Phase 4: Community and Maturity** üöÄ

The final phase is about building a community and ensuring the project's long-term health.

* **Comprehensive Documentation:** Develop a full documentation site covering every command, template, and customization option.
* **Community Templates:** Create a registry or a process for the community to contribute new templates.
* **Release Management:** Set up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for testing and publishing new versions of FastForge.
* **Refinement:** Based on user feedback, refine the CLI commands, improve error handling, and optimize the templates for even better performance and readability.

By following this roadmap, we will build a powerful and beloved tool that empowers developers to build amazing things with FastAPI.
